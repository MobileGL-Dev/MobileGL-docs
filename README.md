# MobileGL  
*(Work-in-Progress | Early Development Phase)*  

**A Cross-Platform OpenGL Implementation for Mobile Devices**  

---

## Overview  
**MobileGL** is an **OpenGL-compatible implementation** designed for mobile platforms, enabling OpenGL applications to run on modern graphics APIs like **OpenGL ES, Vulkan, etc.** through a modular system. MobileGL decouples the frontend (GL API/state) from the rendering backend via specific backend, allowing developers to target multiple platforms with minimal changes.

## Important Notice

**The project is undergoing a complete redesign and rewrite. The previous implementations have been removed or replaced.**
