**A Cross-Platform Render Hardware Interface for Mobile Devices**  
*(Coming-Soon | Designed for OpenGL ES, Vulkan and more Backends)*

---

## Overview

**MobileGL-RHI** (*MG_RHI*) is a lightweight, high-performance abstraction layer designed specifically for mobile devices. Built to support modern graphics APIs like **OpenGL ES**, **Vulkan** and so on, it acts as a bridge between high-level rendering logic and specific backend commands. 

This project is part of the broader **MobileGL** project, which aims to provide a unified OpenGL API implementation across mobile backends while leveraging modern GPU capabilities.

**⚠️ Note**: Development on this component has not yet started.
